# mousemaze

We were visiting family over the holidays and my 5 year old niece had an
educational game on the iPad that contained a simple maze. The game
frustrated her as you had to tap a button to change directions at
_just the right time_ and she was blaming herself whenever she missed
a turn, which made me sad. Bad UX makes for sad children (and programmers.)

So I investigated maze generation algorithms for a bit and made a simple
maze game to play in the browser with the main feature being that the
character stops at every intersection; no more missed turns.
I had about 10 hours, one evening and part of the next morning as they
were leaving, so I treated it as a very short game jam. Good fun.

All the images were taken directly from image searches, except that I made
the mouse in the winning image look like it was at peace by closing its
eyes, and now it reminds of the television advertisement interstitial
mice from 80s German television.

Try it here, but keep in mind it's made for very young kids, maybe ages
3 to 6.
